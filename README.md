# Todo to make template suitable for Advent of code

## Environment
1. First install `rustup` and `cargo` from this [page](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

2. Consider VS Code and [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) plugin as development environment.



## Run tests with cargo
- Run all the tests with cargo `cargo test`
- Run specific test with cargo `cargo test verify_error_handling_not_ok`, to run this test anywhere in your code.
- Run specific test with VS Code.

## Todo


- [x] Test code/days individually with `cargo test`
- [x] Read and parse files example
- [x] Modularize so that previous solutions can be reused without making a mess
- [ ] Demo concurrency with async await abstraction
- [ ] Demo errorhandling with Result
